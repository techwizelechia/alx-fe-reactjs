Form Handling in React
Overview
This project demonstrates how to handle forms in React using two approaches:

Controlled Components: Managing form state manually with useState.
Formik: Using a library for advanced form handling and validation, making the process simpler and more efficient.
The project also implements field validations and simulates a user registration workflow.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
Formik: For form handling and validation.
Yup: For schema-based form validation.
Vite: A fast build tool for creating React projects.
Features
Controlled Form:

Fields: Username, Email, Password.
State is managed manually using useState.
Basic form validation to ensure all fields are filled before submission.
Formik Form:

Uses Formik's built-in state management and validation capabilities.
Fields: Username, Email, Password.
Validation schema defined using Yup to enforce:
Username is required.
Email must be valid and non-empty.
Password must be at least 6 characters long.
Provides user-friendly error messages.

├── components/
│   ├── RegistrationForm.js      # Controlled form component
│   ├── formikForm.js            # Formik form component
├── App.js                       # Entry point for the app
Usage
Controlled Form:

Enter values in the input fields and click "Register."
If any field is empty, an error message will be displayed.
Form submission simulates API registration and logs the entered values.
Formik Form:

Enter values in the input fields and click "Register."
If any field is invalid or empty, the respective error messages will be displayed in real-time.
Submission follows the same simulation as the controlled form.
Dependencies
React: ^18.0.0
Formik: ^2.2.9
Yup: ^1.1.0
Vite: ^4.0.0
Future Enhancements
Integrate with a real backend API for user registration.
Add more advanced form fields like confirm password, date of birth, etc.
Implement dynamic form field generation.
